This folder is for all the extra libraries that we have created for our projects. 

Additional libraries needed from the Arduino IDE are:

 #include <SPI.h>    
 
 #include <Wire.h> 
 
 #include <RF24.h>
 
 #include <printf.h>
 
 #include <nRF24L01.h>
 
 #include "Adafruit_VL6180X.h"
 
 The RF24 and AdaFruit_VL6180X libraries need to be installed via the Library Manager
