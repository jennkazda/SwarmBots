This is a senior capstone project. This project utilizes swarm intelligence that allow multiple robots to communicate amongst one another to perform a variety of formation tasks. 


This project incorporates Swarm Artificial Intelligence into collaborative robotics to perform certain formation tasks. This consists of one communications bot, one master bot, and three to four slave bots. The communications bot is an arduino equipped with an RF sensor and joystick module. The communications bot is used to control the formations of the swarm as well as receiving informationback from the swarm that is used for debugging and understanding what the swarm is doing. The master bot takes commands from thecommunications bot and relays them to the slaves. The master bot has a motor driver, distance sensor, photo interrupt sensors and a rf sensor attached to the arduino. The slave bots take instructions frome of the final formation or what the communications bot sends. This the master bot without any knowledgs uses a Grey Wolf swarm technique where there is one alpha, the master bot, that controls the movements of the pack, the slave bots.
